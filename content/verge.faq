  *****************
  *-General Stuff-*
  *****************

  ======================================
  Q: How do I get started with VERGE?
  ======================================

  A: If you just want to be able to play already released games, all you
  usually need to do is download the particular game, and open the MAIN.EXE
  file.  Occasionally, somone will rename this file to the name of thier
  game, so if you cannot find MAIN, look for another program file with the
  title of the game in it.

  If you want to create a game, you should download VERGE.ZIP, MAPED.ZIP,
  and VERGEDEV.ZIP.  These files contain all of the vital components you
  need to run and make VERGE games.  VERGE.ZIP also includes the pack-in
  demo, which can be looked at with the dev-tools to see how things are
  done in VC.  I would suggest first playing the game to see what VERGE is
  capable of, and then reading the documentation.

  ======================================
  Q. Where is the documentation?
  ======================================

  A:The docs are found in the form of two files: VERGEDOC.TXT, which is a
  basic editing manual, and VERGEC.TXT, which is a list of VergeC commands
  with examples.  Both files are found within VERGE.ZIP, which is available
  at the VERGE Repository. The VERGE Repository is located at:

  http://verge.vivid.com

  Also included in this file are the VERGE main executables, and the most
  current version of Hahn's pack-in demo, which can show VERGE's abilitys
  to anyone intrested.

  ======================================
  Q. I can't hear any sound.
  ======================================

  A: Be sure your BLASTER variable is set properly. Verge uses the BLASTER
     environment variable to detect port, irq and dma settings. If it isn't
     set at all, it won't even be able to detect your SoundBlaster.

  ======================================
  Q. The sound works, but is really choppy, or it skips, or it occasionally
     randomly crashes or does other weird things.
  ======================================

  A: You probably have your sound quality too high. Verge is known to do
     strange things when it can't keep up with the music mixing. The
     following SETUP.CFG has been proven to work on a 486/33 with
     SB16, and should work on most any computer:

     sounddevice 0
     force8bit
     mixrate 22100
     dmabufsize 4096
     joystick 1
     jb2 3
     jb3 2
     end

     Be sure the "interpolate" is NOT in your SETUP.CFG if you have music
     speed problems. Interpolation increases the sound quality but for a
     considerable speed hit. Incidentally, I can get 60fps on my 486/66
     with 8 megs of RAM with my Gravis UltraSound, at full mixing quality.
  :)

  ======================================
  Q. When will VERGE be done?
  ======================================

  A: Hah, as if I know. Haven't you learned by now that the release date of
  software exponentially increases porportionally to how much the authors
  try to set a release date? :)

  Both Verge 1.0, and Verge 2.0 shall be completed. The developers have spoken.

  ======================================
  Q. How much does VERGE cost?
  ======================================

  A: Here's the full legal spiel. (from vecna's own mouth)

  "VERGE is free for non-commercial use. VERGE is Copyright (C)1997,1998 by
  BJ Eirich (vecna), with the exception of the sound code, which is a
  modified version of MikMod 2.09, written by MikMak. Thecurrent pack in
  demo was done by Brian Peterson (Hahn), including the art inside it,
  except or the speech portraits and manga cels which were drawn by Miko.

  I am not liable for the contents of any games written using VERGE. I am
  not liable if VERGE blows up your computer (never known to happen), or if it
  crashes your computer (known to happen), or if it corrupts your hard
  drive (only known to happen to me while debugging :|), or any other damage.
  It's ALPHA software, so use at your own risk.  Satisfaction guaranteed or
  your money back (which is exactly $0). :)

  You may NOT include VERGE in any CDROM, shareware collection, etc without
  my written permission. You can mirror the packages on the VERGE web site
  provided they are unmodified. Realistically, I don't care that much about
  this, I'm just covering my legal behind.

  You may NOT sell any games created with VERGE without my permission. I'm
  willing to be reasonable about this, but my intent is to generate FREE
  RPGs over the internet, and I would prefer the vast majority of VERGE RPGs
  be free.

  I'd rather NOT get paid for VERGE, and NOT have to pay for RPGs made with
  it.

  If a group of people wanted to get together and try to create a
  commercial quality RPG using VERGE, I wouldn't have a problem with that, 
  but some deal would have to be worked out before hand. Ie, I'm going to 
  charge SOMETHING for that, but what exactly that is I don't know yet, so 
  you'll need to contact me.

  I personally am hoping for more free RPGs, but if there is a really high
  quality RPG being produced that people think has commercial potential,
  I'd be willing to make custom engine modifications, etc to help the project
  along.  (Mind you, the commercial game market of the computer world is 
  gruelingly cruel. It'd have to be one REALLY high-quality RPG.)"

  Now, even though vecna has realeased what source code for VERGE 1.0 he had,
  he does still retain full rights to the code.  This means, if you want to 
  modify the code at the most basic levels, toward the end of creating a 
  specialized VERGE game, or if you want to look at the code to learn a few 
  tricks of the trade, then feel free.  However, if you take the code with the 
  intent of creating a VERGE-like creation system, you will be breaking the
  law. Definatly a no-no.  Kapeesh?

 ======================================
  Q. Will there ever be a Windows port?
  ======================================

  A: Sure will be. VERGE was originally meant to avoid Bill Gate's tyrannical 
  and Borg-like ways, but resistance is proving to be futile.  More and more
  computer users are lacking in DOS knowledge, turning into a culture of 
  point-and-clicking zombies. To accomodate them, as well as letting midi 
  support and Hi-color become viable for verge, Verge 2.0 will have a Win95
  version.

  ======================================
  Q. What about other ports to systems like Linux, OS/2, Macintosh, etc?
  ======================================

  A: Although vecna was always intrested in a Linux port, he couldn't even
  get Linux as an OS to get running on his machine.  As far as it is known,
  only DOS shall have a version of VERGE 1.0, although there may be
  dev-tools made for other platforms...but the Verge 1.0 itself, for now, will
  be DOS-only.
  
  Verge 2.0, currently being headed by vecna, is planned for release on both
  DOS and Win95 platforms.  It will not be released until it has been fully
  created and tested, though, so you will have to wait a bit ;)

  ======================================
  Q. When will X be added?
     Are you planning on implementing Y?
  ======================================

  A: Well, the verge-dev team is open for suggestion, but we will blatently
  ignore any suggestion that has been made thousands of times before, and
  said 'no' to each time. If you come up with an intresting feature that
  might be able to be implemented, like a potential VC command or some
  such, it couldn't hurt to ask. You may end up contributing something very
  handy to the community ;)

  ======================================
  Q: What is VERGE Online?
  ======================================

  A: Verge Online is a future project that all of the dev-team is looking 
  forward to greatly.  It will be a graphical MUD similar to Ultima Online, 
  excepting that it will be in the Console RPG style, and won't be as bad as
  UO. Although nothing is set in stone as of yet, there probably will be a
  yearly charge to allow for server maintainence, and to buy new servers.
  This charge will be very affordable, and much better than paying monthly
  like for UO.

  ======================================
  Q. Is MAPSIZE really safe?
  ======================================

  General disclaimer: Back the map up first.

  A: In a nutshell, MAPSIZE is -always- safe to run on non-parallaxing
  MAPs. You do want to be careful you don't cut off parts of the map you 
  wanted to keep, but aside from that you shouldn't have any problems.

  Parallaxing maps are -tricky-, but if you know what you're doing, you can
  use MAPSIZE on them. However, I really would recommend making a backup
  before using it. The problem is that one layer may need to go farther than
  another layer.

  ======================================
  Q. I'd like to install DJGPP. What files do I need?
  ======================================

  Okay, here's how you install DJGPP. First of all, you need to download
  it.

  The official page is at http://www.delorie.com. Another great reference
  page is at http://www.rt66.com/~brennan/djgpp. The files you NEED to compile
  C programs:

  bnu27b.zip    Binary utilities like the assembler, linker, etc.
  djdev201.zip  The DJGPP specific development files.
  gcc2721b.zip  The GCC compiler itself.
  mak375b.zip   The GNU MAKE program. Borland MAKE won't work.

  Other files I recommend:

  csdpmi3b.zip  DPMI provider
  mpl105b.zip   EXE packer.
  rhide13b.zip  A Borland-like IDE for DJGPP based on Turbo Vision.

  Installing:

  1) Make a \DJGPP directory. I *REALLY* recommend not using another name.
  2) Unzip each of these files using -d (expand directories) into \DJGPP.
  3) Add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: (Note the forward
  slashes)
     set djgpp=/djgpp/djgpp.env
  4) Add \DJGPP\BIN into your PATH.
  5) Reboot, and you're ready to roll.

  ======================================
  Q. What files are absolutely needed for a VERGE game to run?
  ======================================

  (ie, what files do I need to pack in a ZIP if I want to distribute my
  game)

  The following files are required by VERGE and can't really be modified:
  CWSDPMI.EXE
  MAIN.EXE
  TRANS.TBL

  The following files are required by the basic VERGE system but can be
  modified:
  SETUP.CFG  
  SAVEGAME.MNU
  LOADGAME.MNU
  DELGAME.MNU
  * Any PCX files referrenced by the MNU files.
  BOX.RAW
  VERGE.PAL
  STARTUP.SCR
  * All music files and PCX files referenced by STARTUP.SCR

  Required data files:
  You will need these files for the game to run, but they will probably
  have been heavily edited by the time you are getting your demo together.
  PARTY.DAT
  ITEMS.DAT
  ITEMICON.DAT
  MISCICON.DAT
  MAIN.SFX
  * All WAVs referenced by MAIN.SFX
  SPEECH.SPC
  MAIN.FNT
  SMALL.FNT
  EFFECTS.VCS (generated from EFFECTS.VC, which is not required)

  Game data files:
  These files will vary depending on your maps and characters. As of the
  date this doc was written, you must have a TEST.MAP to start in.
  .MAP files
  .WAV files
  .CHR files
  .CR2 files
  .MOD/S3M/XM files
  .VSP files

  ======================================
  Q. Can I customize the VERGE palette?
  ======================================

  I would *SUGGEST* using the default VERGE palette. Strongly. But, if you
  MUST change it, here's how.

  First of all, you will need to create a new palette. I -REALLY- must
  stress that you should keep the grey gradients and blue gradients the same
  and in the same places, or else the greyscale savegames and blue menus 
  will NOT look correct in the new palette. Eventually when the source code is
  released you can change how the grey/blue transparencies are calculated, 
  but for the moment, leave those. The rest of the palette is fair game.

  Then you will need to create a VERGE.PAL of that palette. VERGE.PAL is
  just a binary dump of the palette - any really good paint program should 
  support a palette dump (not PSP, it has a goofy format), if not I'll make 
  some sort of palette dumping program and stick it in DEVUTIL.

  Once you have a new VERGE.PAL, you will need to put a copy of it in the
  directory with MAIN.EXE, and in the directory with PCX2VSP.EXE. Any new
  VSPs
  you make will be mapped to the new palette. You'll need to redraw ALL the
  graphics, including character graphics, icons, etc. None of the programs
  besides PCX2VSP force the palette matching, so that shouldn't be a
  problem.

  You will also need to generate a new TRANS.TBL. To do that, runs
  TRANS.EXE and
  copy the resulting TRANS.TBL over the old one.

  ======================================
  Q: How do I open MapEd? I'm not too familiar with DOS...
  ======================================

  A:Well, first, you need to get to the dos prompt. You can accomplish this
  in Windows 95 by going to the 'programs' section of the start menu, and
  clicking on the 'M-S DOS prompt' choice.  When you have done that, you
  will be facing a funny black screen with some text on it. 
  Congradulations! You are in the DOS shell!
  Now you need to get to your verge directory.  you can do this by typing
  "cd (driveletter)\(directory name)". So if your verge directory was named
  'Verge' and was on the C drive, you would type "cd c:\verge". Make sure
  to hit the return key after typing this.  If you did it correctly, a new
  line should appear on the left side of the bottom of the screen that
  looks like:

   C:\verge\>  

  ....or whatever the directory's name is on your computer.
  You're almost done :)  Now, to load a map into maped, you must type
  "Maped (mapname.map)". So, if you wanted to load Island.Map, you would
  type "Maped island.map".  Press enter, and you should enter the magical
  realm of Maped! Happy Vergeing!
  Note: A map file must be in the same directory as MapEd for you to load
  it into MapEd.

  ======================================
  Q: Whenever I load up a map, or when I move to a certain point of the
  map, VERGE crashes with a page fault! What's wrong?
  ======================================

  A:You are probably facing the southern-border bug, more commonly called
  the 'Tarkuss' bug, after the verger who first found it.  Try increasing
  the map's size by twenty or thirty tiles in each direction, using the
  Mapsize.exe utility.

  ======================================
  Q: Whenever I try to load up a game, Verge shuts me out and "WAV load
  error" appears at the top of my screen. What's wrong?
  ======================================

  A: Something isnt loading right in the sound effects department.  It
  could be a .wav file with an improper format, or a bad filename in the
  Main.sfx file. You might have to change the .Wav, or edit main.sfx.

  ======================================
  Q: Whenever I try to load a game, Verge shuts me out and "Bad Module
  format" appears at the top of my screen. What's wrong?
  ======================================

  A: Somewhere in the game, something is trying to play a file that isnt in
  the .XM, .S3M, or .MOD formats.  Verge only can play music modules of
  these types.  Any attempt to play different music types will cause this
  error message to appear.

  ======================================
  Q: I have a problem with verge, and I read this FAQ, but my problem hasnt
  been answered! what do I do?
  ======================================

  A: Well, first of all, read VERGEDOC.TXT, which is included in the
  VERGE.ZIP file, which is downloadable at the VERGE Repository
  (http://verge.vivid.com).  If your problem is VergeC related, be sure
  also to read through VERGEC.TXT, found in the same file as VERGEDOC.TXT.
  (Hey, even I have to refer to these things from time to time, so don't
  think that you're above it ;)  

  If you still are having trouble after reading these files, try asking the
  question on the VERGE Discussion Board, also found at the VERGE Repository.
  Remember that It'll take time for people to come to the
  board, read your message, and reply to it, so dont get angry if nobody
  has answered five minutes after you posted. Have patience!

  * A note to new vergers.  If you do not read the documentation, and ask a
  question that is covered in detail in the docs, there are members of the
  community that will take this opportunity to yell and scream a lot at
  you...It's almost inevitible that some people will :( That is why I
  recommend reading the docs as your first course of action. Just trying to
  prevent some pain ;)

  If all else fails, you could always try going into the verge chat room
  and asking for help....But remember, nobody is obligated to help you in
  the chat room.  The chat room's purpose is to relax and talk to other
  vergers, supposedly after a long day of making games ;)  If asking a
  question, do so in a polite manner.  If you start insulting people in the
  room, you are liable to be kicked or banned from the room. And besides,
  if you ask your question politely, there's a better chance that
  someone'll answer you :)

  ======================================
  Q: Where is the verge chat room?
  ======================================

  A: #verge is located on espernet.  Connect through dream.esper.net (port
  5555), or dwango.esper.net (port 5555), or any of the other espernet
  servers.   

  ======================================
  Q: What do I use to connect to espernet with?
  ======================================

  A: You would need an IRC client, such as mIRC, XiRCON, or ViRC.  Follow
  these links, and you can learn more about these programs, as well as
  download copys of them.

  ======================================
  Q: What is the dev-board?
  ======================================

  A: The dev-board is a tool to ask questions and share ideas  with the
  rest of the VERGE community. It can be a great asset, but it should not
  be misused.
  
  There are currently 3 different boards. A general Disscusion board, a 
  Developers board, and a Help board. The Dev and Help boards are strictly 
  on-topic: any off-topic messages can be reprimanded stiffly.  The General 
  Disscusion board is more relaxed, but flames and spamming will not be 
  tolerated.

  ======================================
  Q: What constitutes 'mis-use' of the dev-board?
  ======================================

  A: Doing things such as insulting someone or something outright is wrong.
  Spamming of any kind is frowned upon.  Using the board to talk about
  subjects that have nothing to do with VERGE, or roleplaying games should
  be avoided, too.

  ======================================
  Q: What is proper use of the board?
  ======================================

  A: Proper use would be to post a well-meaning question that has you
  baffled, to announce a demo being released, to offer services as an
  artist/musician/coder to anyone willing, a request for such services, or
  to throw around ideas.  Please note that most people only want to know
  -when- a demo or realease is out, and it is generally hated when someone
  posts about how they will have a game sometime in the future, but not at
  the moment.  If you are announcing a game, you will be better recieved if
  you have a demo to go along with your announcement.

  ======================================
  Q: What exactly does 'VERGE' stand for?
  ======================================

  A: VERGE stands for Vecna's Extraordinary Roleplaying Game Engine. It was
  started by vecna over a year and a half ago with the vision of a future
  where 2-D tile-based RPGs would not be an endangered species, but be
  freely available to be made and played for all time to come :)

  ======================================
  Q: Who is this vecna fellow?
  ======================================

  A: This man known as vecna is the creator of VERGE. In fact, without him,
  It'd only be an ERGE ;)  For the record, vecna is spelled with a lower-case
  'v', unless beginning a sentance. His nick has nothing to do with any 
  references to a Lich named Vecna in AD&D, or any other reference to the name
  ...it just sounded cool ;)


  ======================================
  Q: Who is this Dev team?
  ======================================

  A: There are currently two dev-teams...One creating Verge 1.0, and one 
  creating Verge 2.0...the Verge 1 effort is being headed by Ric and NichG,
  and the Verge 2 effort is headed by vecna.  Both are always looking for 
  people with programming know-how, and the desire to help in the project. 
  Of particular use would be those with Audio programming skills.
